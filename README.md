# Pattern Recognition in Machine Learning Labs

## Introduction

This repository contains the lab work and implementations I completed during the **Pattern Recognition in Machine Learning** course at the **Indian Institute of Information Technology Design and Manufacturing** (IIITDM). The project showcases various pattern recognition techniques applied using machine learning algorithms on different datasets.

## Course Overview

The **Pattern Recognition in Machine Learning** course focuses on the fundamental concepts of pattern recognition and machine learning. The labs involve the application of these concepts through hands-on projects and practical exercises. This course covers a range of techniques such as classification, clustering, dimensionality reduction, and feature extraction, applied to both supervised and unsupervised learning problems.
